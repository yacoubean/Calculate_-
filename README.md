# Calculate_π

I implemented two algorithms for calculating digits of π in Python. These scripts might not be the most efficient way to calculate π, but it was a fun practice project.

1. [Leibniz Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80)
    1. This is an easy algorithm to implement, but it is very slow. On my PC it takes up to a minute to calculate 8 digits of π.
2. [Chudnovsky Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chudnovsky_algorithm)
    1. A mathematically complicated algorithm (compared to Leibniz Formula), but very fast. On my PC I can calculate 100 digits if π in 5 seconds.
